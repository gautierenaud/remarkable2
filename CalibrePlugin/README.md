# Calibre plugin

This folder contains the tests to implement a plugin that will send a book from my calibre library to the remarkable, going through the remarkable cloud.
In order to do this, I will use [Calibre's plugin tutorial](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/creating_plugins.html#adding-translations-to-your-plugin) and [RM's python api](https://github.com/subutux/rmapy/blob/master/rmapy/document.py).
